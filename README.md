# This is my Data Science Portfolio
In this portfolio you will find data science projects with problems that many companies are trying to solve nowadays. All projects were developed by me. Datasets were obtained from Kaggle website.

Please contact me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mercy-milkah-gathoni-673448b6/) if you are looking to hire an entry level data scientist or data analyst.

In each project was done an end-to-end project, including the following sequence of steps:
- Introduction of the project, giving all the necessary information for the understanding of the project, and a description of the variables used.
- Import of libraries used on the projects.
- Import of the data and getting some basic information of the dataset.
- Data cleaning of the dataset, checking missing values and outliers.
- EDA to plot some charts of the variables, getting useful insights of the problem with the information obtained from the dataset.
- Feature Engineering to adjust some information shown on the dataset to make it possible to run a machine learning algorithm and also doing the feature selection.
- Presets of the model to help the running of the machine learning algorithm, choose of the metrics and fuctions for better visualization of the results given from the models.
- Machine Learning Models, with a list of all algorithm that it will be tested on project and it will be chosen the one with the highest score of the metrics chosen.
- Conclusion of project, summarization of all useful information obtained on project and what action need to be taken to improve the results.

# Projects

## Recommender System
- [EDSA Movie Recommendation 2022](https://github.com/Keltings/Movie-Recommender-Engine/tree/Gathoni): In this project EDSA challenged us to construct a recommendation algorithm based on content or collaborative filtering, capable of accurately predicting how a user will rate a movie they have not yet viewed, based on their historical preferences. These intelligent algorithms can help viewers find great titles from tens of thousands of options in no time, thus increasing revenue to companies that integrate recommender systems into their applications.

## Classification
- [South African Language Identification](https://github.com/Gathoni-Njogu/Mercy-Milkah-Gathoni-Hackathon-South-African-Language-Identification): In this challenge, I was to take text which is in any of South Africa's 11 Official languages and identify which language the text is in. Here, I used NLP's Language Identification, which is the task of determining the natural language that a piece of text is written in.

- [EDSA Climate Change Belief Analysis 2022](https://github.com/Gathoni-Njogu/classification-predict-streamlit-template): In this project, we were to take up the task of creating a Machine Learning model that is able to classify whether or not a person believes in climate change, based on their novel tweet data.Providing an accurate and robust solution to this task gives companies access to a broad base of consumer sentiment, spanning multiple demographic and geographic categories - thus increasing their insights and informing future marketing strategies. 

## Regression
- [Spain Electricity Shortfall Challenge](https://github.com/Gathoni-Njogu/EDSA_OCT21_TEAM1_Predict): In this project, you are tasked to model the shortfall between the energy generated by means of fossil fuels and various renewable sources - for the country of Spain. The daily shortfall, which will be referred to as the target variable, will be modelled as a function of various city-specific weather features such as `pressure`, `wind speed`, `humidity`, etc. Governments all over the world are considering an expansion of their renewable energy resource infrastructure investments. And as such, they require information on the trends and patterns of the country's renewable sources and fossil fuel energy generation.
# Certifications

## AWS Cloud Practitictioner Certifiaction
![alt text](aws_certified_cloud_practitioner_badge.png)
Earners of this certification have a fundamental understanding of IT services and their uses in the AWS Cloud. That means I have demonstrated cloud fluency and foundational AWS knowledge. I am able to identify essential AWS services necessary to set up AWS-focused projects.
